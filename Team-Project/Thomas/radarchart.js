//Practically all this code comes from https://github.com/alangrafu/radar-chart-d3
//I only made some additions and aesthetic adjustments to make the chart look better
//(of course, that is only my point of view)
//Such as a better placement of the titles at each line end,
//adding numbers that reflect what each circular level stands for
//Not placing the last level and slight differences in color
//
//For a bit of extra information check the blog about it:
